You want to improve Stikked? Always welcome! Send us your pull request and you will be honoured in AUTHORS.md.

Some guidelines:

* For PHP only files (not views/themes), please run the PHP Beautifier (http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier) with the following parameters:
```
php_beautifier --indent_tabs -l "IndentStyles(style=bsd) ArrayNested() NewLines(before=function:T_CLASS:if,after=T_COMMENT) ListClassFunction()"
```
* Other people may modify your contribution. Don't take that personal; we all want to improve Stikked. Your input is always welcome!
