== Theme Notes ==

=== Featured Post Slider ===

The slider handles sticky posts as featured. If the slider option is enabled
sticky posts will be displayed in the slider and the main loop will ignore them.
If the option is disabled the loop will display normally, with sticky posts on top.

=== Grid and Blog View ===

The theme comes with 2 view modes: Grid and Blog.
The Grid mode is similar to a web magazine and shown only on the front page.
Secondary pages display in blog view.
You can override this behavior in theme options.

=== Post Thumbnail Functionality ===

Post Thumbnails appear only in post lists, not on single posts.
They can be set by choosing "Set as Featured Image" when uploading an image.

=== Image Post Format ===

Posts with the image format will display the last attached image in a caption.
If a post thumbnail is set, this one will appear instead.

=== Gallery Post Format ===

Posts with the gallery format will display the first 6 attached images, on 3 columns,
and also offers a lightbox for full screen preview.
On single pages images from the [gallery] shortcode display in a lightbox.

=== Audio & Video Post Formats ===

Posts with the audio & video post format will display the attached media files
in a HTML5 <audio> tag with flash fallback.
If more than one media file is attached to the post,
then these will be used as fallback sources.

=== Other Post Formats ===

Posts with the aside, status & quote post formats will displayed with no title;
the status post format will display the user's avatar, in a mannersimilar to Twitter;
the quote post format will only display the post's first <blockquote> tag.
Posts with the link post format will link out to the first <a> tag in the post.

=== Widgets Areas ===

The Theme has 4 customizable sidebars, a widget area in the footer and one on the 404 page.
You can use these area to customize the content of your website.
If no content is be added to the sidebars these will not display.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add thumbnails to posts? =

When editing a post, open the upload tool, select the image you wish to set as thumbnail
and select "Use as Featured Image". Note that thumbnails appear only in blog post lists.
To display then in single posts you need to isert them manually.

= How do I add posts to the slider? =

The slider displays sticky posts as featured. Mark the posts you wish to add to the slider as sticky
and they will be added automatically. Note that this mode disables the normal post order with sticky posts on top
and sticky posts will appear only in the slider.

= The slider is disproportioned =

You need to set a featured image of at least 640x395 for the slider's proportions to align.
The slider cannot be given fixed proportions to comply with the responsive layout.

= It doesn't look good in Opera browser on smaller screens =

Opera browser doesn't (yet) support decimans in percentage dimensions,
hence support for responsive layouts is only limited.

= Some content is not properly aligned =

Because of the responsive nature of the layout it is not possible to make all types of content
fit in all possible dimensions. The layout has been optimized to format the content well on
most poppular desktop and mobile resolutions. If your have a device that does not display them properly
please let us know and we will try to fix it.

= Why does the header widget area have fixed dimensions? =

The header widget area is intended exclusively for displaying ads.
The dimensions are those of standard header ad sizes.

= My media files won't play =

It may be that the server doesn't recognize the media types.
You'll have to register their MIME types.
Add this to your .htaccess file:

AddType audio/ogg .ogg
AddType audio/mpeg .mp3
AddType video/ogg .ogv
AddType video/webm .webm
AddType video/mp4 .mp4
AddType video/x-m4v .m4v

= I can't upload large files =

This is a limitation from your hosting provider.
Try adding the following to your .htaccess file:

php_value upload_max_filesize 128M
php_value max_execution_time 800
php_value post_max_size 128M
php_value max_input_time 800
php_value memory_limit 128M

128M is the maximum file size.
64M should be enough if you're uploading Video
and 16M if you're uploading Audio.

= I don't want to go through all this, isn't there an easier way that just works? =

The simplest way to accomplish this is to add just a FLV video or an MP3 audio.
They should be handled by the flash players and servers should recognize their type.
But you're missing on all the HTML5 goodies.

= I uploaded more media files, but I only see one =

Post formats are designed so only one media file is shown.
The other detected files are used as fallback sources for the first one.
If you would like to embed more media, a plugin may be more helpful.
