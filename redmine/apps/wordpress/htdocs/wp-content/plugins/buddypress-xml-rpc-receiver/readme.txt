== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

Allow your BuddyPress members to access certain BuddyPress features via XML-RPC.
You may restrict settings on a wp_cap level. 
You can select which RPC commands to allow as well.

= How do members retrieve data? =

A client is required to send XML-RPC commands. You can build one yourself or try
an existing one. For Android, there is [BuddyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.yuttadhammo.buddydroid&hl=en) that works with this plugin.
