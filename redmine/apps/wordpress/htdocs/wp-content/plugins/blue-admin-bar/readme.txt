Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: trunk
Stable tag: trunk

A pretty WordPress blue version of the admin bar. Supports BuddyPress when BP_USE_WP_ADMIN_BAR is true. RTL support for 3.3.

== Description ==

When we were making mockups for the refreshed admin bar in 3.3, I created a blue version to mix things up and ended up really liking it. It looks nice with both included admin color schemes, especially the blue. It's also helpful for developers who maintain staging and production environments - I personally use the blue to remind me that I am looking at local development.

== Installation ==

Blue Admin Bar is most easily installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your blog administration panel.

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the `blue-admin-bar` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy your blue admin bar!
