Allow Categories is a plugin that allows you to permission different user to view only specific categories within your wordpress blog.

== Description ==

Allow Categories is a plugin that allows you to permission different user to view only specific categories within your wordpress blog. Its a modification of L. Fargue's Restrict (http://stknights.free.fr/?p=69) categories plugin.

Users are assigned permissions to view posts in certain categories

If users don't have permission to certain posts, those posts aren't shown, including in the main view and archives. As of version 0.4.0 there is now a list of categories that are public (visible to all users).
This is an initial version, so please report any errors or bugs.

Previous versions required installation of ac_authenticator.php (http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/angsumans-authenticated-wordpress-plugin-password-protection-for-your-wordpress-blog/). This code is now optionally included.
