Let the members of your site post an update to their activity stream from anywhere in your site or any other subsite in a multisite installation instead of going to their profile page in order to do so. 

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that i created for one of my projects. However, i believe that others will find it useful and so i decided to upload it to wordpress.org. 
there are no settings or many feature. The plugin simply adds a button "post update" to the toolbar. Once a user (logged in) clicks on the button a form will pop up. The form will have a text area for the user to enter any update
and another input to enter a link to a video. When the user submit the form the plugin will post the info to his activity stream.  

I have not planned on this plugin or have any plans for it for the future. However, you are more than welcome to send suggestion to info@geomywp.com. If the plugin will get attention and requestes i will be more than happy to extend it and its features.
