# PHP Redmine API

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for Redmine API, written with PHP5.

Uses [Redmine API](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api/).

## Features

* Follows PSR-0 conventions and coding standard: autoload friendly
* API entry points implementation state :
 * OK Attachments
 * OK Groups
 * OK Custom Fields
 * OK Issues
 * OK Issue Categories
 * OK Issue Priorities
 * *NOK Issue Relations - only partially implemented*
 * OK Issue Statuses
 * OK News
 * OK Projects
 * OK Project Memberships
 * OK Queries
 * OK Roles
 * OK Time Entries
 * OK Time Entry Activities
 * OK Trackers
 * OK Users
 * OK Versions
 * OK Wiki

## Todo

* API entry points :
* Check header's response code (especially for POST/PUT/DELETE requests)
 * See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9183178/php-curl-retrieving-response-headers-and-body-in-a-single-request/9183272#9183272
* Maybe Guzzle for handling http connections
 * https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle

## Limitations

Redmine is missing some APIs for a full remote management of the data :
* List of activities & roles : http://www.redmine.org/issues/11464
* ...

A possible solution to this would be to create an extra APIs implementing the missing entry points. See existing effort in doing so : https://github.com/rschobbert/redmine-miss-api

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.2 with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension,
* "Enable REST web service" for your Redmine project (/settings/edit?tab=authentication)
 * then obtain your *API access key* in your profile page : /my/account
 * or use your *username & password*

## Install

Through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/), simply run :

```bash
$ php composer.phar require kbsali/redmine-api:~1.0
```

## Basic usage of `php-redmine-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Redmine\Client('http://redmine.example.com', 'API_ACCESS_KEY');
//-- OR --
$client = new Redmine\Client('http://redmine.example.com', 'username', 'password');

$client->api('user')->all();
$client->api('user')->listing();

$client->api('issue')->create([
    'project_id'  => 'test',
    'subject'     => 'some subject',
    'description' => 'a long description blablabla',
    'assigned_to' => 'user1',
]);
$client->api('issue')->all([
    'limit' => 1000
]);
```

see `example.php`
